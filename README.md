# moviesposter

## Project Overview
In this project, I used poster images downloaded from themoviedb.org API as placeholder images and some random texts to represent the overview of the movies in the details view.

## Why this project?
The recyclerview is more flexible and efficient version of the android listview. This project demonstrates the use of recyclerview, intents and cardview to achieve a gridlayout display of movies and details of each movie.
